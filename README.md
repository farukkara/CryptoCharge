CryptoCharge is a payment system that allows electric vehicle owners to pay for their charging at stations using cryptocurrency in a contactless way. This system is built using Lisp and integrates with various cryptocurrency exchange APIs and Visa/Mastercard payment APIs. It also sends notifications to the user's phone via Bluetooth after a successful transaction. This project aims to make charging electric vehicles more convenient and secure for the users.

This code is just a skeleton, a starting point, to give you an idea of what the payment system could look like, there are many details that need to be filled in, like handling communication with APIs, the data exchange, the error handling, the validation of user's input, and the security measures needed to protect the user's data and the financial transaction.

You should also work closely with legal and compliance teams to ensure that the payment system adheres to all relevant laws and regulations.
